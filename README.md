## Run the (local) Compose CI

### Requirements

You need Docker Desktop installed and running (eg: for vulnerability scan with Docker Scout).

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```bash
DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=<your_docker_hub_username>
DOCKER_HUB_PAT=<your_docker_hub_pat>
TAG=demo
ABOUT=Cracker project, the HTTP wasm runner
AUTHOR=@k33g
```
### Build and run

```bash
docker compose -f compose.ci.yml up --build
```
